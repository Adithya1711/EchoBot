# EchoBot
Out of Curiosity and High Interest, I landed up making this telegram echo bot that echoes back the messages it receives to the user.
This bot echoes the messages without "forwarded from user" and helps in saving files from copyright strikes. Although it seems simple, 
the bot has a really powerful role for those who know how to use it.


# Requirements
You need telebot library to use this bot


# Installation
pip install pytelegrambotapi


# Usage
After the installation of the package, update the bot token to your bot token and then run the python file.
